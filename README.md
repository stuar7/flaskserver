    Windows: https://delightnet.nl/index.php/mqtt/12-mqtt-broker-installation

    For accessability purposes, this smart-parking demo uses "allow_anonymous true" for mosquitto.conf.

    Linux: https://www.vultr.com/docs/install-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-on-ubuntu-20-04-server/

    Mac: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mosquitto
5. A database is present, but may be initialized with:
    flask --app parkr init-db
A table for each carpark will need to be manually created, along with the sensor entries.

## App Layout:
| File/Directory  | Description |

# Issues & Compatability Problems
Requires Python3

Complete termination of the app requires discarding the terminal the program was launched in, otherwise threads may continue to exist.

# Run The Server
flask --app parkrÂ run --host=0.0.0.0 --no-reload --with-threads

--host=0.0.0.0 will make the website available on all network interfaces. It is advisable to select a specific ip address.
